## 📌 About

This repository contains **all exercises I completed during the Piscine at 1337**, including:

- `Shell00`  
- `C00 → C09`  
- `Rush00`  

The Piscine is an intensive coding bootcamp where you learn by **doing, failing, improving, and collaborating**. There are:

- ❌ No classes, no teachers  
- 🤝 Peer-to-peer learning & evaluation  
- 💡 Project-based challenges  
- 🕹️ Gamified, hands-on approach  

> At 1337/42, programming is learned by **building, testing, and improving solutions**.

### ⚠️ Note

I might add a **full detailed README on each day later**, or maybe I already did and just forgot to remove this note 😅.  

This repo is mainly **for learning and sharing knowledge** — not for copying solutions. Do your exercises first, then compare if you want!
