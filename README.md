## Welcome! 😄  

This repository contains **all exercises I completed during the Piscine at 1337**, including:

- `Shell00` ✅  
- `C00 → C09` ✅  
- `Rush00` ✅

## 🏫 About 42

42 is an international tuition-free coding school. **No teachers, no classes, no lectures** — you learn by working on projects, helping peers, and solving problems independently. The campus is open 24/7 and the learning model focuses on **problem-solving, autonomy, and teamwork**.

## 🏊 Piscine (Pool)

The Piscine is an intensive 1-month program designed to test your **logic, motivation, and learning ability**.  
- Daily projects in Shell and C  
- Team Rush projects  
- **Most important:** never give up! If you fail an exercise or feel discouraged, keep going and ask your peers for help.  


> The full Piscine program includes **Shell00 to Shell01**, **C00 to C13**, and **Rush00 to Rush03** (or Rush02).


I may **add a full README for each day later**, or maybe I already did and forgot to remove this note 😅.

## ✅ Evaluation System

42 evaluates your projects and exercises through multiple stages:  

- **Norm:** Your code is checked for coding style rules (indentation, function length, file structure).  
- **Correction (Peer-to-Peer):**  
  - A fellow student tests your code.  
  - You must **explain your solution** and answer all questions in the correction sheet.  
  - **Points system:** You gain **1 point** for correcting someone else and lose **1 point** if someone corrects you.  
- **Moulinette:** After passing peer correction, your code is automatically tested for correctness, edge cases, and memory issues.

<br>

## 🧪 Exams

- Exercises are **level-based**, starting from level 0. You get a **random exercise** at your level; if you pass it, the next level is unlocked.  
- Exams test your **logic, correctness, problem-solving, and coding habits**.  
- **Do not start anything until staff tells you to begin.**
  
<br>

## 🔐 Login & Exam Workflow

<br>

 ***Step 0: Do not forget to register for the exam before the exam day. Ask your peers how to register.***
 
<br>

1. Go to a **school computer** before the exam starts and wait until staff tell you to start .  
2. Set your **username** and **mod password** both as `exam`. You have **10 minutes** to do this or you fail.  
3. Open terminal and run or it s open automatic as i remember :  
   ```bash
   examshell
   ```
4. Enter your real intra username and password.

5. The folders you should use:

``` 
For the exams, you should open 3 or 4 terminals to work efficiently.
I also recommend researching more about the login process on YouTube or other articles
or asking peers who already have Piscine experience for guidance.
```

- the orgin one when you do examshell appear

- subject → exam subject files

- rendu → where you write your solutions and push them

- traces → check failing tests (file_name0, file_name1, etc.) optional but important

***Use traces to debug failing test cases.***

Push exercises directly from your computer (no git clone needed):
```c
git add filename
git commit -m "any message"
git push
```

5- do gradme at the origin folder
```
grademe
```

## 🔁 Recoding Phase

The Recoding phase ensures that you **really understand your code**, not just that it passes tests.  

- Staff may call you after projects or exams to **explain and debug your work live**.  
- You may also be given **exercises at the level of your completed days and exams** to solve on the spot.  
- During recoding, you may be asked to:  
  - Rewrite parts of your code  
  - Answer detailed questions about your solution  
  - Show your reasoning and problem-solving approach  
- Staff checks your understanding of **logic, edge cases, memory management, and adaptability**.  
- Passing the Moulinette does **not** guarantee passing recoding — this phase tests **true knowledge**.
