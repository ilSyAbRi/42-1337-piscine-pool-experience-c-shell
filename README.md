### Welcome! 😄  
This repository contains **all exercises I completed during the Piscine at 1337**, including:

- `Shell00` ✅  
- `C00 → C09` ✅  
- `Rush00` ✅  

The **Piscine** is an intensive, 4-week coding bootcamp at 1337 / 42 Network where students **learn by doing, not by listening to lectures**.  

- No teachers, no traditional classes  
- 100% project-based learning  
- Peer-to-peer collaboration and evaluation  
- Encourages experimentation, problem-solving, and creativity  
- Designed to **push you beyond your comfort zone** while supporting growth 

> No teachers, no lectures — just **projects, challenges, and teamwork**. Think of it like a **gamified coding bootcamp**! 🎮💻

I may **add a full README for each day later**, or maybe I already did and forgot to remove this note 😅.

## 📝 Detailed Projects Table

| Day / Project | Mini-Lesson / Explanation |
|---------------|---------------------------|
| 🐚 **Shell00** | **Focus:** Linux commands, file navigation, basic shell scripting.<br>**Exercises:** Learn `ls`, `cd`, `pwd`, `cp`, `mv`, `rm`, and write small shell scripts.<br>**Skills:** Command-line fluency, automation, git basics.<br>**Why it matters:** This is your foundation. You must be comfortable navigating Linux to survive the Piscine.<br>**Fun Notes:** Spent more time typing `cd ..` than writing scripts 😅. You’ll be shocked how fast you’ll master the terminal. |
| **C00 – Intro to C** | **Focus:** Variables, loops, functions, conditionals.<br>**Exercises:** `ft_putchar`, arithmetic operations.<br>**Skills:** Program structure, compiling code.<br>**Why it matters:** Loops and conditionals are the backbone of everything else. Understanding them is key.<br>**Fun Notes:** I might add a full README for C00 later. Think of this as your C “warm-up” day. |
| **C01 – Pointers & Memory** | **Focus:** Pointers, dereferencing, addresses.<br>**Exercises:** Swapping values, manipulating arrays.<br>**Skills:** Pointer handling, memory understanding.<br>**Why it matters:** Pointers are magical in C 🪄. They let you directly access memory — powerful but tricky.<br>**Fun Notes:** Memory can be scary; leaks will haunt you if you forget `free()`. |
| **C02 – Strings & Arrays** | **Focus:** Implement C string functions (`ft_strcpy`, `ft_strcmp`, `ft_strlen`).<br>**Skills:** String and array manipulation, memory layout.<br>**Why it matters:** Strings are everywhere. Understanding them is like learning to “speak C” fluently.<br>**Fun Notes:** Strings can be tricky with null terminators — watch out! |
| **C03 – Advanced String Manipulation** | **Focus:** Complex string exercises, edge cases.<br>**Skills:** Defensive programming, handling tricky cases.<br>**Why it matters:** Life has edge cases, and so does coding. Learn to think like a computer.<br>**Fun Notes:** Tests will break your code if you’re not careful. Debugging is your friend. |
| **C04 – Integers & Bases** | **Focus:** Numeric conversions, base calculations.<br>**Skills:** Arithmetic logic, problem decomposition.<br>**Why it matters:** Binary, decimal, hexadecimal — all become your playground for logic.<br>**Fun Notes:** Feeling like a number wizard 🧙‍♂️ as you convert bases. |
| **C05 – Recursion & Iteration** | **Focus:** Recursive factorial, power functions, printing sequences.<br>**Skills:** Iterative vs recursive thinking.<br>**Why it matters:** Recursion is elegant and powerful. Knowing when to use it vs iteration is key.<br>**Fun Notes:** Your brain will “click” when recursion finally makes sense — feels like magic! |
| **C06 – `argc` & `argv`** | **Focus:** Command-line arguments.<br>**Exercises:** Small CLI programs.<br>**Skills:** Flexible input parsing, dynamic programs.<br>**Why it matters:** Your programs can now react dynamically to user input — huge step toward real applications.<br>**Fun Notes:** Seeing your program respond differently to different inputs is super satisfying! |
| **C07 – Dynamic Memory Allocation** | **Focus:** `malloc`, `free`, dynamic arrays, string duplication.<br>**Skills:** Memory management.<br>**Why it matters:** Programs that can grow dynamically are powerful. Mismanage memory and watch chaos unfold 😅.<br>**Fun Notes:** Always free your memory or suffer the wrath of leaks! |
| **C08 – Headers, Macros & Structs** | **Focus:** Code modularization, struct definitions, multiple files.<br>**Skills:** Modular, readable, reusable code.<br>**Why it matters:** Organize your code like a professional. Structs = neat data. Headers = reusable functions.<br>**Fun Notes:** Your code finally looks clean and manageable. |
| **C09 – Libraries & Makefiles** | **Focus:** Writing Makefiles, linking code libraries.<br>**Skills:** Build automation, reusable code.<br>**Why it matters:** Makefiles save lives. Linking libraries means you never repeat yourself.<br>**Fun Notes:** Makefiles = project superhero cape 🦸‍♂️. |
| 🚀 **Rush00 – First Team Project** | **Focus:** Combine Shell & C knowledge in a timed team challenge.<br>**Skills:** Teamwork, problem-solving, project planning.<br>**Why it matters:** Everything comes together under time pressure. Teaches real-life coding teamwork.<br>**Fun Notes:** Learned to communicate, split tasks, survive deadlines 😅. Rush00 = intense but rewarding. |
