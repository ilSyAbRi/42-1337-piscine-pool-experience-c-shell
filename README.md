## Welcome! 😄  

This repository contains **all exercises I completed during the Piscine at 1337**, including:

- `Shell00` ✅  
- `C00 → C09` ✅  
- `Rush00` ✅

#### PICINE ? POOL ?

The **Piscine** is an intensive, 4-week coding bootcamp at 1337 / 42 Network where students **learn by doing, not by listening to lectures**.  

- No teachers, no traditional classes  
- 100% project-based learning  
- Peer-to-peer collaboration and evaluation  
- Encourages experimentation, problem-solving, and creativity  
- Designed to **push you beyond your comfort zone** while supporting growth 

> No teachers, no lectures — just **projects, challenges, and teamwork**. Think of it like a **gamified coding bootcamp**! 🎮💻

I may **add a full README for each day later**, or maybe I already did and forgot to remove this note 😅.

## 📝 Piscine Day-by-Day – Fully Informative

| Day / Project                          | What It Really Involves                                                                                                     | Key Tasks & Exercises                                                                                   | What You Learn / Skills Gained                                                                                           |
| -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **🐚 Shell00 – Shell & Unix Fundamentals** | Learn how to use the Unix/Linux shell like a real developer: navigate directories, manage files, work with pipes and redirections, explore environment variables, check permissions, write simple shell scripts, and use Git for version control. You will also practice combining commands, chaining operations, and debugging scripts in a live environment. | Create, move, copy, delete files/directories (`mkdir`, `rm`, `cp`, `mv`), list and explore files (`ls`, `find`, `tree`), redirect outputs (`>`, `>>`), use pipes (`|`) to chain commands, write small scripts (`.sh`) to automate tasks, initialize Git repos, commit changes, push to GitHub. | Terminal fluency, scripting basics, file system understanding, automation skills, Git workflow (commit & push), debugging shell scripts, environment familiarity. |
| **C00 – Intro to C**                    | Basic C programming: syntax, variables, functions, loops, conditionals, and output. Anda intro to building small programs that compile cleanly. | `ft_putchar`, `ft_print_alphabet`, `ft_print_reverse_alphabet`, `ft_print_numbers`, simple arithmetic exercises, basic `main()` and functions. | Basic C syntax, compilation with `gcc`, understanding function calls, loops, conditionals, working with standard output. |
| **C01 – Pointers & Arrays**             | Introduction to pointers and arrays: how memory is referenced, accessed, manipulated, and passed to functions. | Swap integers using pointers, pointer dereferencing, simple array manipulation, multiple levels of pointers. | Memory addresses, pointers, passing by reference, arrays interaction, debugging memory issues, pointer logic. |
| **C02 – Strings & Arrays**              | Handling strings and character arrays; implement basic library-like functions manually without using `<string.h>`. | Implement `ft_strlen`, `ft_strcpy`, `ft_strcmp`, `ft_strdup`. Iterate over char arrays and handle null-terminated strings. | String manipulation, memory layout, array handling, defensive programming, safe character operations. |
| **C03 – Advanced String Manipulation**  | More advanced string tasks. Handling more complex transformations and edge cases. | Capitalize text, check printable characters, handle concatenation safely, manipulate strings with multiple rules. | Defensive programming (think through edge cases), deeper string logic, character operations. |
| **C04 – Integers & Bases**             | Work with numeric logic and base conversions, including implementing functions not available in the standard library. | Convert numbers to binary/octal/hexadecimal, map digits to chars, perform arithmetic without standard library; implement custom base conversions. | Numeric reasoning, conversion between representations, breaking problems into algorithmic steps. |
| **C05 – Recursion & Iteration**         | Practice recursive programming and iteration; compare both techniques. | Recursive factorial, power functions, Fibonacci numbers, sequence printing; iterative equivalents. | Understand recursion and iteration, call stack, recursive function design, algorithmic thinking, debugging recursive logic. |
| **C06 – `argc` & `argv`**               | Command-line argument handling. Programs read and process parameters from CLI. | Sum numbers from CLI, validate arguments, handle incorrect parameters gracefully. | How to read CLI arguments, parse input, validate and respond, design flexible command-line programs. |
| **C07 – Dynamic Memory Allocation**     | Use `malloc` and `free` to allocate memory dynamically. Manage heap memory safely. | Create dynamic arrays, copy strings, build flexible data structures, free memory to avoid leaks. | Dynamic memory handling, safe allocation/deallocation, heap memory management, working with runtime-sized structures. |

Modular coding practice. | Split code into `.c` and `.h` files, define and use structs, implement macros, modularize functions. | Modular programming, maintainable code, reusable structures, better project organization, teamwork readiness. |
| **C09 – Libraries & Makefiles**        | Build systems, compile multi-file projects, static libraries, automated builds. | Write Makefiles that compile multi-file projects, create static libraries, automate linking. | Build automation, code reuse, dependency management, project organization, prepare for large codebases. |
| **🚀 Rush00 – First Team Project**     | Timed team project integrating all Shell and C skills. Realistic project environment with collaboration and deadlines. | Coordinate with peers, integrate exercises, follow project specifications, debug and test code collaboratively. | Teamwork, communication, group problem-solving, time management, real world integration of key skills. |

## ⚠️ Advice

This repository is **for educational purposes**.  

Do all exercises yourself first; the Piscine is about **learning, problem-solving, and growth**.  

> I may add a **full README for each day later**, or maybe I already did and forgot to remove this note 😅.
